                <p style="font-family : 'Arial'">The first recorded description of the social interactions that could be enabled through networking was a series
                    of memos written by J.C.R. Licklider of MIT in August 1962 discussing his “Galactic Network” concept.
                    He envisioned a globally interconnected set of computers through which everyone could quickly access data and
                    programs from any site. In spirit, the concept was very much like the Internet of today. Licklider was the first
                    head of the computer research program at DARPA,4 starting in October 1962. While at DARPA he convinced his successors
                    at DARPA, Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and MIT researcher Lawrence G. Roberts, of the importance of this networking concept.</p>
                <p style="font-family: 'Arial'">Leonard Kleinrock at MIT published the first paper on packet switching theory in July 1961 and the first book on the subject in 1964.
                    Kleinrock convinced Roberts of the theoretical feasibility of communications using packets rather than circuits, which was a major
                    step along the path towards computer networking. The other key step was to make the computers talk together. To explore this, in 1965
                    working with Thomas Merrill, Roberts connected the TX-2 computer in Mass. to the Q-32 in California with a low speed dial-up
                    telephone line creating the first (however small) wide-area computer network ever built. The result of this experiment was the
                    realization that the time-shared computers could work well together, running programs and retrieving data as necessary on the
                    remote machine, but that the circuit switched telephone system was totally inadequate for the job. Kleinrock’s conviction of the
                    need for packet switching was confirmed.</p>

        <div class="grid-left">
            <p style="font-family: 'Arial'">In late 1966 Roberts went to DARPA to develop the computer network concept and quickly put together his plan for the “ARPANET”,
                publishing it in 1967. At the conference where he presented the paper, there was also a paper on a packet network concept from
                the UK by Donald Davies and Roger Scantlebury of NPL. Scantlebury told Roberts about the NPL work as well as that of Paul Baran
                and others at RAND. The RAND group had written a paper on packet switching networks for secure voice in the military in 1964.
                It happened that the work at MIT (1961-1967), at RAND (1962-1965), and at NPL (1964-1967) had all proceeded in parallel without
                any of the researchers knowing about the other work. The word “packet” was adopted from the work at NPL and the proposed line speed
                to be used in the ARPANET design was upgraded from 2.4 kbps to 50 kbps.</p>

        <div class="grid-left" style="text-align: left">
            <p style="font-family: 'Arial'">In August 1968, after Roberts and the DARPA funded community had refined the overall structure and specifications for the ARPANET,
                an RFQ was released by DARPA for the development of one of the key components, the packet switches called Interface Message Processors
                (IMP’s). The RFQ was won in December 1968 by a group headed by Frank Heart at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN). As the BBN team worked
                on the IMP’s with Bob Kahn playing a major role in the overall ARPANET architectural design, the network topology and economics
                were designed and optimized by Roberts working with Howard Frank and his team at Network Analysis Corporation, and the network
                measurement system was prepared by Kleinrock’s team at UCLA.</p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Arial'">Due to Kleinrock’s early development of packet switching theory and his focus on analysis, design and measurement, his Network
                Measurement Center at UCLA was selected to be the first node on the ARPANET. All this came together in September 1969 when BBN installed
                the first IMP at UCLA and the first host computer was connected. Doug Engelbart’s project on “Augmentation of Human Intellect”
                (which included NLS, an early hypertext system) at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) provided a second node. SRI supported the Network
                Information Center, led by Elizabeth (Jake) Feinler and including functions such as maintaining tables of host name to address mapping
                as well as a directory of the RFC’s.</p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Arial'">One month later, when SRI was connected to the ARPANET, the first host-to-host message was sent from Kleinrock’s laboratory to SRI.
                Two more nodes were added at UC Santa Barbara and University of Utah. These last two nodes incorporated application visualization
                projects, with Glen Culler and Burton Fried at UCSB investigating methods for display of mathematical functions using storage
                displays to deal with the problem of refresh over the net, and Robert Taylor and Ivan Sutherland at Utah investigating methods of
                3-D representations over the net. Thus, by the end of 1969, four host computers were connected together into the initial ARPANET,
                and the budding Internet was off the ground. Even at this early stage, it should be noted that the networking research incorporated
                both work on the underlying network and work on how to utilize the network. This tradition continues to this day.</p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Arial'">Computers were added quickly to the ARPANET during the following years, and work proceeded on completing a functionally complete
                Host-to-Host protocol and other network software. In December 1970 the Network Working Group (NWG) working under S. Crocker finished
                the initial ARPANET Host-to-Host protocol, called the Network Control Protocol (NCP). As the ARPANET sites completed implementing
                NCP during the period 1971-1972, the network users finally could begin to develop applications.</p>

    <div class="page-section">
        <div class="grid-left">
            <p style="font-family: Cambria">In October 1972, Kahn organized a large, very successful demonstration of the ARPANET at the International Computer Communication
                Conference (ICCC). This was the first public demonstration of this new network technology to the public. It was also in 1972 that
                the initial “hot” application, electronic mail, was introduced. In March Ray Tomlinson at BBN wrote the basic email message send and
                read software, motivated by the need of the ARPANET developers for an easy coordination mechanism. In July, Roberts expanded its
                utility by writing the first email utility program to list, selectively read, file, forward, and respond to messages.
                From there email took off as the largest network application for over a decade. This was a harbinger of the kind of activity
                we see on the World Wide Web today, namely, the enormous growth of all kinds of “people-to-people” traffic.</p>
